## Exercise 1, Part b

### Sampling

First, a hundret value from a log-normal distribution are sampled and stored in an object called "values".
```{r}
values <- rlnorm(100,1,.25)
```

### Plots

Then two histogram of the values are created, where the second is on log scale.
```{r}
hist(values,main="histogram 1")
hist(log(values),main="histogram 2")
```

### Inference

The empirical mean and variance of our sample can be calculated by the built in functions "mean" and "var". 
The empirical mean is:
```{r}
mean(values)
```
and the empirical variance is:
```{r}
var(values)
```
